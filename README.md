# Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Ray Images using Deep Learning CNN 🩺

## Overview

The Pneumonia Detection App is a web application built to assist in the diagnosis of pneumonia using chest X-ray images. It utilizes deep learning techniques implemented with TensorFlow and Keras for image classification, and is deployed using Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.

## Features 🚀

- **Upload Image**: Users can upload a chest X-ray image to the app.
- **Prediction**: The app predicts whether the uploaded image indicates pneumonia.
- **Comparison**: Provides visual comparison with sample normal and pneumonia chest X-ray images.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit to ensure easy navigation and interaction.

## Try it Out 🔍

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework for model training and prediction.
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API (running on TensorFlow) used for building and training the deep learning models.
- **Streamlit**: Open-source app framework used to build interactive web applications for machine learning and data science.
- **Python**: Programming language used for development.
- **matplotlib, Pillow (PIL)**: Python libraries used for image visualization and processing.
